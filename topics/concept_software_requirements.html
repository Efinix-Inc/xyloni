# Download the Efinity Software

To develop your own designs for the T8 device on the board, you must install the Efinity® software. You can obtain the software from the Efinix® Support Center under Efinity Software \([www.efinixinc.com/support/](https://www.efinixinc.com/support/)\).

The Efinity® software includes tools to program the device on the board. Refer to the Efinity® Software User Guide for information about how to program the device.

**Note:** Efinity® documentation is installed with the software \(see **Help** \> **Documentation**\) and is also available in the Support Center under Documentation \([www.efinixinc.com/support/](https://www.efinixinc.com/support/)\).
