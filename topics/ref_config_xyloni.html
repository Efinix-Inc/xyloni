# Configuration

The XyloniÂ® Development Kit supports three different configuration modes: SPI passive mode, SPI active mode, and JTAG mode.

In SPI active and passive mode, you can choose which image to load from the SPI flash by pulling the `CBSEL0` and `CBSEL1` pins high or low.

|CBSEL0|CBSEL1|Notes|
|:----:|:----:|-----|
|High|Low|Load configuration image 0.|
|Low|High|Load configuration image 1.|

**Note:** For more details on configuration, refer to [AN 006: Configuring Trion FPGAs](https://www.efinixinc.com/support/docsdl.php?s=ef&pn=AN006).
