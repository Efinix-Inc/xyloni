# Power On

To turn on the development board, connect the micro-USB connector to a computer. Upon power-up, the power is input to the on-board regulators to generate the required 3.3 V, 2.5 V, 1.8 V, and 1.2 V for components on the board. When these voltages are up and stable, LED PWR illuminate, giving you a visual confirmation that the power supplies on the board are up and stable.
