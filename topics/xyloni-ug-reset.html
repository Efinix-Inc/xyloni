# Reset

The T8F81C2 device is typically brought out of reset with the `CRESET` signal. Upon power up, the T8F81C2 device is held in reset until `CRESET` toggles high-low-high.

`CRESET` has a pull-up resistor. When you press CRST pushbutton, the board drives `CRESET` low; when you release CRST pushbutton, the board drives `CRESET` high. Thus, a single press of CRST provides the required high-low-high transition.

After toggling `CRESET`, the T8F81C2 device goes into configuration mode and reads the device configuration bitstream from the flash memory. When configuration completes successfully, the device drives the `CDONE` signal high. `CDONE` is connected to a green LED \(LED CDN\), which turns on when the T8F81C2 device enters user mode.
