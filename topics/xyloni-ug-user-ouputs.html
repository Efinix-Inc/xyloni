# User Outputs

The board has 4 yellow user LEDs that are connected to I/O pins in T8F81C2 banks 2A, 1B and 2B. By default, the T8F81C2 I/O connected to these LEDs are set as active high. To turn a given LED on, pull the corresponding I/O signal high.

**Note:** When adding these GPIO in the EfinityÂ® Interface Designer, configure them as output pins.

|Reference Designator|T8F81C2 Pin Name|Active|
